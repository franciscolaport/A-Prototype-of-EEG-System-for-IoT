Code for the paper: A Prototype of EEG System for IoT [1].

Main document for overlapped windows: mainOverlap.m performs feature extraction and classification.
Main document for non-overlapped windows: mainNonOverlap.m performs feature extraction and classification.

Different feature extraction methods can be configured/compared as well as different window sizes.
